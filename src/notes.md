What is an array and how does it work?
* Stores a sequence of elements
* Each element must be the same data type
* Occupies a contiguous block of memory
* Can access access data in constant time with this equation: memory_address = starting_address + index * data_size

What is an hash function and how does it work?
* Deterministic: For a given input, the output will always be the same.
* Defined output range: For a hash table of size 16, all keys must hash to a value 0-15. For smaller values, this is usually accomplished using the modulo % operation.
* Predictable Speed: Hash functions for hash tables should be lightning fast while cryptographic hashes (like bcrypt) should be very slow.
* Non-invertible: You should not be able to reconstruct the input value from the output. This trait is important in cryptographic hashes but not necessary for general hash tables.

What is a hash table, how does it work?
* Is a data structure (array structure)
* hash table map keys to unique indexes for O(1) retrieval
* Hash Tables have an underlying Array structure
* This is why they are as fast at accessing elements as arrays
* The main difference is that Hash Tables are indexed using a hash function in an unordered fashion, whereas arrays are indexed via contiguous ordered indices
* HashTable code is fairly similar to DynamicArray code
